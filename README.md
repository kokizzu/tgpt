## Installation ‚è¨

### Download for GNU/Linux üêß or MacOS üçé

The default download location is `/usr/local/bin`, but you can change it in the command to use a different location. However, make sure the location is added to your PATH environment variable for easy accessibility.

You can download it with the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aandrew-me/tgpt/main/install | bash -s /usr/local/bin
```

If you are using Arch Linux, you can install the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tgpt-bin) with `paru`:

```bash
paru -S tgpt-bin
```

Or with `yay`:

```bash
yay -S tgpt-bin
```

### Install with Go

```bash
go install github.com/aandrew-me/tgpt/v2@latest
```

### Windows ü™ü

-   **Scoop:** Package installation with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) can be done using the following command:

    ```bash
    scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aandrew-me/tgpt/main/tgpt.json
    ```

<!-- -   **PowerShell:** Open PowerShell as administrator and run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aandrew-me/tgpt/main/install-win.ps1 -OutFile "$PWD\install-win.ps1";  .\install-win.ps1
    ```

    If you receive an error stating "execution of scripts is disabled on this system," run this command instead (and confirm with a "Y"):

    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned; Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aandrew-me/tgpt/main/install-win.ps1 -OutFile "$PWD\install-win.ps1";  .\install-win.ps1
    ``` -->

### Proxy

Support:
- Http Proxy [ `http://ip:port` ]
- Http Auth [ `http://user:pass@ip:port` ]
- Socks5 Proxy [ `socks5://ip:port ]`
- Socks5 Auth [ `socks5://user:pass@ip:port` ]

If you want to use a proxy, create `proxy.txt` file in the same directory where the program is located and write your proxy configuration there.

Example:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### From Release

You can download the executable for your operating system, rename it to `tgpt` (or any other desired name), and then execute it by typing `./tgpt` while in that directory. Alternatively, you can add it to your PATH environmental variable and then execute it by simply typing `tgpt`.


## Uninstalling
If you installed with the install script, you can execute the following command to remove the tgpt executable
```
sudo rm $(which tgpt)
```
Configuration file is usually located in `~/.config/tgpt` on GNU/Linux Systems and in `"Library/Application Support/tgpt"` on MacOS
